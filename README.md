# Linear Regression with TensorFlow

This project demonstrates a simple linear regression model using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained to fit a synthetic dataset generated by a linear function with some added noise. 

## Overview

The code in this repository shows how to implement and train a basic linear regression model using TensorFlow's Keras API. The goal is to fit a straight line to a set of data points that follow the equation `y = 3x + 2`, with some Gaussian noise added.

## Code Explanation

### 1. Importing Libraries

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

We start by importing the necessary libraries:
- **TensorFlow** for building and training the machine learning model.
- **NumPy** for generating the synthetic data.
- **Matplotlib** for plotting the data and model predictions.

### 2. Generating Synthetic Data

```python
x = np.linspace(-10, 10, 1000)
y = 3*x + 2 + np.random.normal(scale=5, size=x.shape)
```

- We generate 1000 evenly spaced values for `x` between -10 and 10.
- The corresponding `y` values are computed using the linear equation `y = 3x + 2`, with some added noise drawn from a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 5.

### 3. Creating the Model

```python
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, input_shape=[1]),
])
```

- We define a simple sequential model with one dense layer containing a single neuron (`units=1`). This layer will output the predicted `y` values.
- The `input_shape=[1]` indicates that the model expects a single input feature.

### 4. Compiling the Model

```python
model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.001), loss='mean_squared_error')
```

- The model is compiled with the following hyperparameters:
  - **Optimizer**: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a learning rate of `0.001`.
  - **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE), which measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual `y` values.

### 5. Training the Model

```python
model.fit(x, y, epochs=5, verbose=1)
```

- The model is trained for 5 epochs, where it iteratively adjusts the weights to minimize the loss function. The `verbose=1` argument displays the progress during training.

### 6. Plotting the Results

```python
plt.scatter(x, y, color='blue', label='Original Data')
plt.plot(x, model.predict(x), color='red', label='Model Prediction')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

- After training, we plot the original data points (in blue) and the model's predictions (in red).
- The scatter plot shows the noisy data, and the red line represents the model's best fit to this data.

## Conclusion

This project provides a simple example of how to perform linear regression using TensorFlow and Keras. By training on synthetic data, the model learns to approximate the underlying linear relationship, despite the noise in the data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

To install the required packages, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```

## How to Run

To execute the code, simply run the Python script in your terminal:

```bash
python linear_regression.py
```

You will see the training progress in the terminal, followed by a plot showing the original data and the model's prediction.
